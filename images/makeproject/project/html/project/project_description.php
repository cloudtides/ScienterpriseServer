Welcome to Science@Enterprise! Nowadays, enterprises own a lot of idle computing resources in their private cloud, while research projects are restricted by limited computing power. In this project, we aim to decrease this imbalance by building CloudTides, which is an elastic platform on idle cloud resources. Enterprises can donate their idle cloud servers, and individual organizations or research groups can make use of these resources.
